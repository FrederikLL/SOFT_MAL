## Sorting Shakespeare project

I've solved the assignment in jupyter notebook.

I initially tried solving each algorithm without help, but ended up googling for help in all of them. 
After that i took time to sit down and understand how and why the solution worked.

I've fetched the complete works shakespeare file, but am just using a small fragment of it for quicker testing.
